			<h5>A few things about me!</h5>
			
			<p class="arrow">I´m a future Full-Stack Web Developer!</p>
			
			<p class="arrow">With the help of this great team at CodeFactory, everyone can learn to code & how great it feels to learn something new.</p>
			
			<p class="arrow">But i have to admit, the first week was really intense & even thought a few times "why am I doing this"?:-)</p>
			
			<p class="arrow">I´m doing it,because it will help me in the future to get the job i really want & it challenges me to think differently!</p>
			
			<p class="arrow">Coding is something I never thougt I would learn. I have a completely different education. Before I decided to do this I only worked with machines, even I work right now in a hospital, I do this so I can effort this new education so I can work something completely new and I´m going to try to excel myself in it!</p>
			
			<p class="arrow">Well I guess this is enough for now, but I´m really excited to see where all of this is going to take me!</p>
			
			<p class="arrow">Hopefully, I can achieve the goals I have for myself & I can´t wait to see what I´m going to learn next week!</p>
